# Odin - minimal application framework

A minimal application framework with a Processing-like API, and a fraction of the features.
I am using Odin, because the language seems to be very promising.
It is very C-like, but fixes a lot of the bad syntax and inconvenient aspects.

The tooling is still a bit lacking, however. The language server could use some improvements though:
- renaming variables with F2
- not showing erronous red lines on unsaved files

Despite that, it is still more fun to use than C, and it's use in JangaFX is enough evidence that it is a viable language to ship.
