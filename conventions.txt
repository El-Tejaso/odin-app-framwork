Function names:

Trying out a new API convention that might result in an API that is easier to memorize:
    (verb)(_object)?(_property)?

Common (verb)s:

set_<object_>?<property> - sets data in memory or a 3Rd party API
get_<object_>?<property> - gets data in  memory or a third party API, or initializes a struct

new_<object> - allocates and initializes a struct
free_<object> - frees something we got from a new_ method
resize_<object> - reallocates the backing datastructures to a new exact size

upload_<object> - sends a large amount of data to a 3rd party API, like an entire mesh to OpenGL
draw_<object> - pushes vertices and triangles to a mesh buffer


Old convention:
    (Object_)(Action)
It was much easier to name things,
